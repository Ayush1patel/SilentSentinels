## 🎯 Vision

**Silent Sentinel** emerged from a single, haunting question:

> *What happens when you can't hear the danger that could kill you?*

23 million Americans live in silence. For them, every fire alarm, every breaking window, every gunshot exists only as vibrations they may never feel in time.

**This project exists to change that.**

## 📐 Spec-Driven Approach

Kiro's spec-driven development transformed our approach from chaotic hacking to structured engineering.

### The Three-Layer Spec System
