## Mission Statement

**Silent Sentinel exists to protect those who cannot hear danger.**

We believe that safety should not depend on the ability to hear. Our AI-powered emergency detection system transforms sound into sight, giving deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals the same reaction time as everyone else.

---

## Core Values

### 🛡️ Safety First
Every design decision prioritizes user safety. False negatives (missed emergencies) are unacceptable. We optimize for sensitivity while managing false positives through intelligent verification.

### ♿ Accessibility by Default
This is not an afterthought. The entire system is designed for users who cannot rely on audio cues. Visual, haptic, and notification alerts are primary—not secondary.

### 🧠 Intelligent, Not Noisy
AI-powered verification ensures users aren't overwhelmed with alerts. The system thinks before it acts, analyzing patterns and context before declaring an emergency.

### ⚡ Real-Time or Nothing
Emergency detection must be instantaneous. Our target latency is under 500ms from sound to alert.

## Success Criteria

1. **Detection Accuracy:** >98% for critical sounds (gunshots, fire alarms, glass breaking)
2. **False Positive Rate:** <5% after AI verification
3. **Alert Latency:** <500ms from sound to visual alert
4. **Accessibility Score:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliant
5. **User Confidence:** Zero missed emergencies in testing
